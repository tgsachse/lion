getting started
====
To work on Lion, you'll need to clone this repository using ``git``. Execute the following command:
::
  git clone https://github.com/tgsachse/lion.git
  
Afterwards, familiarize yourself with the documentation for `discord.py (rewrite)`_, the `commands extension`_, and the `example cog`_ before you start working.

To run your changes, install and configure Lion as described in the README_:
::
  sudo bash install --handle-dependencies
  sudo lion --token "your token"
  sudo lion --cogs enable [your cogs...]
  sudo lion --service start
Note that you'll need to `invite your version of Lion`_ to your own development server for testing.

functions
====
This software provides 2 major utility functions that will be of use to you. **DO NOT** use the ``context.send()`` function that is provided by ``discord.py``. You **MUST** use these 2 functions to interact with Discord or your pull requrests will be rejected.
::
  async def respond(context,
                    message,
                    delete_original=True,
                    ignore_formatting=False,
                    in_default_channel=True,                  
                    **keyword_arguments)
                    
The 1st function allows Lion to respond to commands in Discord. Your 1st argument must be ``context``, and your 2nd argument is your response string (``message``). By default, this function deletes the original user's request, formats your response with a ping to the user, and sends your message to the user's server's default bot channel. This function also accepts all of the keyword arguments that ``discord.py``'s ``context.send()`` function accepts (like ``embed`` and ``tts``). All responses must use this function. It is a full replacement for ``context.send()``.
::
  async def throw_error(context,
                        error,
                        message=None,
                        delete_original=True,
                        ignore_formatting=False,
                        in_default_channel=True,
                        **keyword_arguments)

The 2nd function sends an error to the user. Your 1st argument must be ``context`` and your 2nd argument must be ``error``. By default, the ``error``'s message is displayed to the user, but this can be overridden by passing a new message as the 3rd argument. This function also takes all of the keyword arguments that ``respond()`` takes, and all of the keyword arguments that ``context.send()`` takes.

To use these functions, your cog must ``import utilities``. Please refer to the `example cog`_ for examples.
