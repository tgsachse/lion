This bot is meant to be simple and lightweight. I'm writing it with plugins in mind, however it is not intended for mass distribution.
My primary goal is to provide functions to improve the functionality of the UCF CS Discord server.  

Existing Functions:
- Polls
- User count
- UCF parking status

Planned Functions:
- Auto roles
- Message counter
- Requests queue
- Help menu
- Cave status (stretch)
- Eustis status (half stretch)
